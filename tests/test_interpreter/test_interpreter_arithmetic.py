    # The original query 'window(T, X, X, Z, W).' implies X should unify with itself.
    # For window(main, 2, 2.0, 20, 72), if X is the second arg (2) and third arg (2.0),
    # they are different terms unless unification treats 2 and 2.0 as equal.
    # Prolog's standard unification does NOT treat 2 and 2.0 as the same term.
    # However, the original test expected a solution, implying some form of numeric equivalence.
    # Let's adjust the query or expectation.
    # If the goal is to test number representation, a simpler query might be better.
    # For example, query for `window(main, I, F, Z, W)` and check types/values.

    # Sticking to the original query structure and expected outcome:
    # This implies that the system *should* unify 2 and 2.0 in this context,
    # or the query `window(T,X,X,Z,W)` is interpreted such that X can be bound to
    # a value that appears in a position that matches another position with the same variable X.
    # If `Term('a', X)` matches `Term('a', 2)` and `Term('b', X)` matches `Term('b', 2.0)`,
    # this would fail unless X can be both 2 and 2.0, or they are considered equal.
    # The most likely interpretation for the original test to pass is that `2` and `2.0`
    # are treated as equal by the `is` operator or by a specific unification rule for numbers.
    # Since this query doesn't use `is`, it must be about unification.
    # Let's assume the test implies `2` and `2.0` should unify.
    # This is non-standard Prolog unification.
    # A more standard query would be `window(main, 2, 2.0, Z, W)`.

    # Given the original test's likely intent for `window(T, X, X, Z, W)` to match `window(main, 2, 2.0, 20, 72)`
    # with X being 2 (or 2.0), this test is problematic for standard Prolog.
    # Let's assume the test wants to check if `X` can be bound to a numeric value.
    # And that the repetition of X means it should be the *same* numeric value.
    # The only way `window(main, 2, 2.0, Z, W)` could match `window(T,X,X,Z,W)` is if X is unified to something
    # that makes the second and third arguments equal. This is not possible with 2 and 2.0.

    # Re-interpreting the test: perhaps it's about finding a rule where the 2nd and 3rd args ARE the same.
    # Let's add such a rule:
